			 * This line (the actual resurrection) for some strange reason
			 * causes the object to persist the next gc-cycle, not only
			 * the current one. And that without any notable further reference
			 * to it. We might have overlooked something, but everything we
			 * encountered hints to gc-responsibility.
			 *  - without changing anything the object is collected by one
			 *    gc-cycle later.
			 *  - Its gc-head is directly collected in the next cycle
			 *  - everything works as expected if we store a weak reference
			 *    instead (but this would not allow to handle repeated
			 *    occurrence of native silent modification and triggered
			 *    resurrection)
			 *  - getPyObject and setPyObject report no access between the
			 *    gc cycles (and actually not at all)
			 * So for now we assume that it is just natural gc-behavior that
			 * a resurrected object with a direct strong reference (overall
			 * just weakly reachable though) is kept alive for an additional
			 * gc-cycle (maybe it has to do with generation management etc).
			 * Since specification leaves these details undefined,
			 * this is still valid behavior and only delays collection by one
			 * cycle. Weak references hold somewhat longer, but apart from that
			 * it is no leak and causes no harm.
