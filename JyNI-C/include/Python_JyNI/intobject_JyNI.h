/* Integer object interface */

/*
PyIntObject represents a (long) integer.  This is an immutable object;
an integer cannot change its value after creation.

There are functions to create new integer objects, to test an object
for integer-ness, and to get the integer value.  The latter functions
returns -1 and sets errno to EBADF if the object is not an PyIntObject.
None of the functions should be applied to nil objects.

The type PyIntObject is (unfortunately) exposed here so we can declare
_Py_TrueStruct and _Py_ZeroStruct in boolobject.h; don't use this.
