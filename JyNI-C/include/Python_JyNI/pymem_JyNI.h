/* BEWARE:

   Each interface exports both functions and macros.  Extension modules should
   use the functions, to ensure binary compatibility across Python versions.
   Because the Python implementation is free to change internal details, and
   the macros may (or may not) expose details for speed, if you do use the
   macros you must recompile your extensions with each Python release.

   Never mix calls to PyMem_ with calls to the platform malloc/realloc/
   calloc/free.  For example, on Windows different DLLs may end up using
   different heaps, and if you use PyMem_Malloc you'll get the memory from the
   heap used by the Python DLL; it could be a disaster if you free()'ed that
   directly in your own extension.  Using PyMem_Free instead ensures Python
   can return the memory to the proper heap.  As another example, in
   PYMALLOC_DEBUG mode, Python wraps all calls to all PyMem_ and PyObject_
   memory functions in special debugging wrappers that add additional
   debugging info to dynamic memory blocks.  The system routines have no idea
   what to do with that stuff, and the Python wrappers have no idea what to do
   with raw blocks obtained directly by the system routines then.

   The GIL must be held when using these APIs.

/* Functions

   Functions supplying platform-independent semantics for malloc/realloc/
   free.  These functions make sure that allocating 0 bytes returns a distinct
   non-NULL pointer (whenever possible -- if we're flat out of memory, NULL
   may be returned), even if the platform malloc and realloc don't.
   Returned pointers must be checked for NULL explicitly.  No action is
   performed on failure (no exception is set, no warning is printed, etc).
