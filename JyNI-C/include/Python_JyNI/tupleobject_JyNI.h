/*
Another generally useful object type is a tuple of object pointers.
For Python, this is an immutable type.  C code can change the tuple items
(but not their number), and even use tuples are general-purpose arrays of
object references, but in general only brand new tuples should be mutated,
not ones that might already have been exposed to Python code.

*** WARNING *** PyTuple_SetItem does not increment the new item's reference
count, but does decrement the reference count of the item it replaces,
if not nil.  It does *decrement* the reference count if it is *not*
inserted in the tuple.  Similarly, PyTuple_GetItem does not increment the
returned item's reference count.
