 * JyAbstract.c
 *
 * This file contains rather trivial push-through implementations of
 * several methods callable from Java. Methods in this class would
 * usually have been part of JyNI.c, but we decided to out-source them,
 * (since implementations are trivial) in order to unburden JyNI.c a bit.
 * Most methods here directly correspond to methods in abstract.c, which
 * gave the name to this file.
